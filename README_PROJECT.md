# Install Environment

## Mandatory Tools

You will need the following development tools to build, run, and test this project:

* Jetbrains Rider - obtain a license key for Jetbrains dotUltimate 
    
* Install the .NET6.0 SDK. Available for [download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

------

# Setup Environment

## Build The API

* Build the solution in Rider
* OR `dotnet build src\SaaStack.sln` in the terminal

## Memory Allocation

In Rider, 'Search Everywhere' for the action `change memory settings`, and set `8000M` of memory, then restart Rider.

## HTTPS Certificate

Open a terminal and run: `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`

## Optional Local Infrastructure

You only need the tools below installed if you are going to run specific `Integration.Storage` tests, for the storage adapters you need to use in your codebase.

* If using the `SqlServerRepository`, install `SQL Server 2019 Developer`. Available for [download here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866662)
* If using the `RedisInMemRepository`, install `Redis Server` locally to run the tests. Available for [download here](https://redis.io/download)
* If using the `EventStoreEventository`, install `EventStore` locally to run the tests. Install using the Chocolatey command: `choco install eventstore-oss`

> We normally run these storage integration tests in CI periodically.

## Azure Local Environment

### Azure Functions Host

For security, and to ensure the Azure Functions can run when running locally, you need to create your own version of `local.settings.json`.

1. In the `AzureFunctionsHost` project add a new file called `local.settings.json`
2. Copy the following JSON:

```json
{
   "IsEncrypted": false,
   "Values": {
      "DebugMode": true,
      "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
      "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
      "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY": ""
   }
}
```

> DO NOT add this file to source control!

### Azurite

> You only need this step prior to running the `Integration.Storage` tests against Azure Storage (Queues, blobs, and tables)

1. Open a Terminal.
2. Navigate up to the `tools` directory
    1. `cd ..`
    2. `cd /tools`

3. Run: `npm install`

## AWS Local Environment

### LocalStack

> You only need this step prior to running the `Integration.Storage` tests against AWS Storage (SQS, S3, DynamoDB, and RDS)

1. [Install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [Install Python package manager](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
3. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
4. Install localstack:
    - `python -m pip install localstack` ([LocalStack CLI setup instructions](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli))
5. Test it's working by running `localstack start` in your terminal

> Docker will need to be running in the background for LocalStack to start up

# Branching Strategy

We recommend that you to work on the _main_ branch collaboratively, using principles and practices for [_trunk-based development_](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

This does not exclude the possibility of using 'feature branches' to do some work, but it does mean that we will prefer not to use branches in most cases.

* In order to work collaboratively on _main_, it means more communication, collaboration, and coordination with each other, which should be the norm.
* The _main_ branch must remain _green_ and releasable at all times, so if we decide to work on something that we know that can't be released into the wild until complete (and that will block _main_ being released), then using a feature branch may be appropriate to guard against blocking _main_.
* For all other things, and as a normal daily practice, we will use feature toggles to hide work in progress that we don't want our end-customers to experience.

# Build & Deploy

When pushed, all branches will be built and tested with GitHub actions

# Local Development, Debugging and Manual Testing

## Committing and Pushing Code

1. Ensure that the solution contains `0` warnings and `0` compile errors.

![Warnings](docs/images/Rider-Warnings.png)

> Note: warnings are generated by Rider, and by Code Analysis rules that we have running against the solution.

2. Run these tests:

​	In Rider, run all C# tests with Category= `Unit`, `Unit.Architecture` and `Integration.Web`

> Note: Use `Group By > Category` in Rider's unit test explorer to view these three categories easily.

OR, in a terminal:

- `dotnet test --filter:"Category=Unit|Category=Unit.Architecture" src\SaaStack.sln`

- `dotnet test --filter Category=Integration.Web src\SaaStack.sln`

3. Configure your "Commit " window to select the "Cleanup with 'Full Cleanup' profile".

![Automatic Code Cleanup](docs/images/Rider-Commit-Settings.png)

## Changing Rider Settings

This solution contains comprehensive code formatting, and error-checking settings in the team-shared settings file `src\SaaStack.sln.dotSettings` that contains numerous code style rules, 'Live Templates', 'File templates', and other important settings that we need to share across the team for consistency.

When changing any settings in Rider, make sure you save them for the whole team (team-shared), then add the `SaaStack.sln.dotSettings` file to your next commit to save those rules for the rest of your team.

![Settings](docs/images/Rider-Settings.png)

## Stubs and Fakes

We use various stubs/fakes (whichever definition you like) in concert with configuration settings (`appsettings.json`)
to create different environments for testing and for production.

There are 3 environments you need to be aware of, and how they differ in their dependencies and configuration:

1. Local (manual) testing (aka F5 debugging)
2. Automated integration testing
3. Production

> Note: In all cases, in all environments, there should NEVER be any production settings nor **secrets** in any `appsettings.json` file anywhere in this codebase! These production settings and secrets should only be defined in your CD pipeline.

### Production

In production builds, we build and deploy the code in the `ReleaseForDeploy` build configuration.

> Note: In this build configuration certain testing stubs, certain testing endpoints and certain hardcoded testing values and functions are compiled out of the code (behind the `TESTINGONLY` conditional compilation variable). We absolutely need to do this because these specific testing code pieces should never exist in the production codebase, and may even expose security vulnerabilities and exposures we simply don't want in production.

The various 3rd party *adapters* we need in production (eg `SendGridHttpServiceClient` and the `SqlServerRepository`)
will be configured in the DI container (in `Program.cs` of the Api/WebHost project) to use code to talk to real 3rd party APIs, and will be configured with specific production settings in the `appsettings.json` file (overwritten by your CD server).

These are the real 3rd party public API adapters, which if used with production settings, locally or in testing, may incur financial service charges and/or corrupted customer data!

> Note: This should never happen by accident, but read and follow the next 2 sections to avoid the possibility of this happening - there are several safeguards in place, that should make this impossible, without engineering that possibly intentionally.

You will notice that in production we configure the current `IRepository` to be the `SqlServerRepository` .

### Automated Integration Testing

> On the CI server, integration testing is run in the `Release` build configuration, which permits the inclusion of `TESTINGONLY` code in the compilation necessary for integration testing. Integration testing on your local machine should be done in the `Debug` build configuration. The only difference between the two configurations is that there are some compiler optimizations configured in `Release`, which are closer to code in Production.

In automated integration testing, (executed on both your local machine and on the CI build server) we run the APIs you are testing in their original production DI configuration defined in the `Program.cs` file (in the respective ApiHost project of the API code you are testing).

That DI configuration is modified slightly to swap out the 3rd party adapters for that ApiHost, so that we can program the 3rd party adapters to behave the way the tests need them to (and to query them for certain interactions).

This is what we modify and how:

We run this API production DI code in-process in a Kestrel web server in the same process as your Integration Tests (e.g. in the process of `xunit.console.exe`, not as a separate process). We replace the `appsettings.json` file with the one in your integration testing project

>  Which should never ever contain ANY production settings or secrets!

We then manipulate the DI container (seen in the `TestStartup.cs` of your integration testing project) and replace certain dependencies (e.g. the 3rd party adapters like: `INotificationsService,` etc) with their respective hardcoded Stubbed equivalents (found in the `Stubs` directory your integration testing project).

You will notice that in integration testing we have switched out the currently configured `IRepository` for the `LocalMachineFileRepository`, so that you can do all your testing without a SQL database being available on your local machine.

> Note: These integration testing stubs will likely use no configuration settings from `appsettings.json` as their responses and behavior are hardcoded/canned in that test project.

You may wish to modify these stubs to add the ability to query them to ensure they called in the right ways in testing.

### Local Manual Testing

> Note: When you are manual testing (like using F5 debugging), make sure that you compile the code and run it in `Debug` (or `Release`) build configuration that will include all code marked up by `TESTINGONLY` compilation variable.

When you run any of the ApiHost projects in this solution in your local environment, you are starting that ApiHost project at a specific IP address, which starts a separate Kestrel server in *external* processes of its own (e.g. `ApiHost.exe` for the API).

In local testing, all external services (i.e. SendGrid, Unleash, etc.) should be directed (via config) to point to the local Stub console application `External.StubServices,` which will respond with canned responses to any calls to these external services. The goal of this is to make it possible to run locally without connecting to any real live services over the internet.

> Note: When you are doing manual testing on your local machine, either through the browser or with PostMan or with any other tools, you are actually running the code in production configuration as far as the adapters which DI injects into your code. However, these adapters will be using the configuration found in `appsettings.json` of the ApiHost project.

There will be numerous statements in the code using `#if TESTINGONLY` to determine which concrete dependencies are actually used in `Debug` (or `Release`) configuration.

You will notice that in local debugging we have switched out the currently configured `IRepository` for the `LocalMachineFileRepository`, so that you can do all your local debugging without a SQL database being available on your local machine.

The `LocalMachineFileRepository` is configured to place your files in `Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData`, which resolves to `%appdata%` on Windows and `/home/<you>/.local/share` on MacOS.

## Running The Code

1. Build the code:

- In Rider, build the solution
- OR `dotnet build src\SaaStack.sln` in the terminal

2. Run the backend:

* In Rider, run the `AllHosts` compound configuration (runs the API server and the Stubs console app)

3. Access the API on `https://localhost:5001`

#### Troubleshooting

Sometimes (especially on MacOS) the processes when run, don't shut down properly, and ports: `5001` and `5656` are left running, which blocks those ports from being used by any new process you start.

The message looks something like this:

```
System.IO.IOException: Failed to bind to address https://127.0.0.1:5656: address already in use.
```

To kill these processes:

* On Windows, `taskkill /f /im dotnet.exe`
* On MacOS:
    * Find the processes: `lsof -Pni | grep "5001\|5101\|5656"`
    * Kill the processes: `kill -9 <processid>` where `<processid>` is the ID of the process in the list

Alternatively, in MacOS:

* In the terminal, use `lsof -ti :[PORT]` to locate the PID of the process, e.g. `lsof -ti :5101`.
* Open "Activity Monitor", locate the process with that PID and stop the process.

## Testing The Code

### Everyday tests

In Rider, run all C# tests with Category= `Unit`, `Unit.Architecture` and `Integration.Web`

OR, in a terminal:

- `dotnet test --filter:"Category=Unit|Category=Unit.Architecture" src\SaaStack.sln`

- `dotnet test --filter Category=Integration.Web src\SaaStack.sln`

> Note: All tests will be run in parallel in `Rider` or in `dotnet test`.

### Storage tests

Only run when code in the Storage layer has changed:

`dotnet test --filter Category=Integration.Storage src\SaaStack.sln` (requires installing the server storage components listed at the top of this page)

> Note: If any of the `Integration.Storage` category of tests fail, it is likely due to the fact that you don't have that technology installed on your local machine, or that you are not running your IDE as Administrator, and therefore cannot start/stop those local services without elevated permissions.

> Note: The Amazon Storage tests require LocalStack to be running on your computer in order to work. After installing LocalStack, run `localstack start` in a terminal.

#### External Adapter tests

These tests run only when any External adapters have changed:

`dotnet test --filter Category=Integration.External src\SaaStack.sln` (requires internet access to external services)

# Versioning the Code

> Note: We use the 2 dot [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) scheme.

The latest changes for this new version are recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and they follow a [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) convention.

> All assemblies and all hosts will share the same version number.
>
> We will be using a tool called [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to update the version and changelog when creating new releases.

First, make sure that all changes are documented in the various sections of the `[Unreleased]` section of the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

2. Copy the new version number to `src/GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs`

> For example:

* `[assembly: AssemblyVersion("2.0.0.0")]`
* `[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("2.0.0.0")]`
* `[assembly: AssemblyInformationalVersion("2.0.0")]`

4. Commit, tag, and push the new version changes.

> Note: Each build in CI will automatically append the last build number to the semver and update the version in `GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs`
